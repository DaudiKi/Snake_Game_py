- **L**: Reset leaderboard during gameplay
- **ESC**: Quit game

#### Initials Input

### 9. Technical Details

#### Data Structures
- **Snake**: `deque` for efficient head/tail operations
- **Obstacles**: `set` for fast collision checking
- **Concurrent Foods**: `list` for bonus foods
- **Leaderboard**: `list` of dictionaries with score/initials

#### Collision Detection
- Wall collision: Check if head is outside grid bounds
- Self collision: Check if head position is in snake body
- Obstacle collision: Check if head position is in obstacles set
- Food collision: Check if head position matches food position

#### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient data structures for collision checking
- Minimal redraws with targeted updates
- Sound generation only when needed
- Trail effects with automatic cleanup

### 10. Error Handling
- Graceful sound system fallback
- File I/O error handling for leaderboard
